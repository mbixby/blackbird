		if it is a string like 'some/directory' then `-o some/directory` will be added to `coffee` compiler. 
		if it is false or not string then it will compile your `script.coffee` to the directory it is in.

		#### Example:
		Directory is relative to the file you are editting if specified such as
			compileDir": "out"
		Directory is absolute if specified such as
			compileDir": "/home/logan/Desktop/out"

		#### Example:

			"relativeDir": "/home/user/projects/coffee"

		So
			"/home/user/projects/coffee/app.coffee" will compile to "/home/user/projects/js/app.js"
			"/home/user/projects/coffee/models/prod.coffee" will compile to "/home/user/projects/js/models/prod.js"
